{"name":"Dakait","tagline":"A tool to download files from your FTP/SFTP servers in an organized way.","body":"Dakait\r\n=========\r\nDownload files from remote servers and effortlessly manage them.\r\n\r\nYou have large amounts of large files on a remote server (e.g. a seedbox) and you want to download and stage them nicely.  Dakait lets you do that.\r\n\r\nYou create tags (pretty looking names for local directories) and tag your remote file on a web-interface.  Dakait takes care of downloading and staging them for you.\r\n\r\nCurrent Release\r\n---\r\nCurrent release version is `0.0.6`.  It will do what its supposed to do, but it has a long way to go.\r\n\r\n[Download Now](https://github.com/verma/dakait/releases/download/0.0.6/dakait-0.0.6-standalone.jar)\r\n\r\nHow to run\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou need a configuration file to run Dakait.  Modify and rename `config.example.json` to `config.json`. This file must reside in the working directory (path where you run this program from).\r\n\r\nOnce you have the jar file, make sure your server has a recent enough version of java.  You can start the server by running the following command\r\n\r\n    java -jar dakait-0.0.6-standalone.jar\r\n    \r\nThis will start a server and bind to port `3000`.  Now point your browser to `http://server-address:3000/`\r\n\r\nWhat are tags?\r\n---\r\n\r\nTags are an easy way of classifying a file.  \r\n\r\nLets say you create a tag called `Ubuntu Image` and assign it a target `images/ubuntu`.  While browsing the remote server through Dakait's web-interface, whenever you tag a file or a directory with `Ubuntu Image` Dakait will start downlaoding the tagged file/directory to your `<local-base-path>/images/ubuntu` Directory.  Note that reapplying a tag just initiates a new download, this will change in a future release when Dakait becomes smart enough to detect this.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n---\r\nI really wanted to learn clojure and really really needed a tool like this.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration Options\r\n--\r\nDakait understands the following options\r\n\r\n### config-data-dir (required)\r\nLocal directory to cache running state.  Tags and tag associations are saved in this directory.\r\n\r\n### sftp-host (required)\r\nThe remote SFTP host.  At this time Dakait support `sftp` protocol only.\r\n\r\n### private-key (required)\r\nThe private key to use to login to the remote server.\r\n\r\n### local-base-path (required)\r\nDirectory to save downloaded files to.  The tag target directories will be created under this directory.\r\n\r\n### sftp-port (optional)\r\nSSH port on remote server\r\n\r\n### username (optional)\r\nSSH username to use, defaults to the username of the user running the program.\r\n\r\n### base-path (optional)\r\nThe base path to `cd` into on the remote machine, your session starts in this directory, and you cannot traverse back.\r\n\r\n### concurrency (optional)\r\nNumber of simultaneous downloads.  Defaults to `4`.\r\n","google":"UA-48307976-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
